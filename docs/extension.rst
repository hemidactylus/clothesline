.. _extension:

Customize
=========

It is possible to create new classes to operate
on any custom "field", provided it has the behaviour
of a continuous line of values spanning the space
between a "minus infinity" and a "plus infinity" of some kind.

Refer to the example extension
:py:class:`enriched.string_interval_set.StringIntervalSet`
which defines Intervals and Interval Sets over the (fully-ordered)
domain of "all strings".

.. note::
  More explanations are planned for a future release.
