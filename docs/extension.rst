Extension
=========

It is possible to create new classes to operate
on any custom "field", provided it has the behaviour
of a continuous line of values spanning the space
between a "minus infinity" and a "plus infinity" of some kind.

Here's a short tutorial, with reference to the example :code:`StringIntervalSet`.

See :py:class:`clothesline.enriched.string_interval_set.StringIntervalSet`

.. note::
  **Coming soon**.
